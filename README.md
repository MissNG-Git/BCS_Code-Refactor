# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Website Accessibility Optimization

Starting with a client-provided foundation code, my task was to refactor (improve without changing functionality) the <a href="https://github.com/MissNG-Git/BCS_Code-Refactor/blob/main/Develop/index.html">HTML</a> & <a href="https://github.com/MissNG-Git/BCS_Code-Refactor/blob/main/Develop/assets/css/style.css">CSS</a> files to ensure elements were included to ensure accessbility of the site. This will allow for people with disabilities to access the website with assistive technologies and also position the site more favourably on search engines like Google :simple_smile:

As I was working on someone else's code, I made sure to adhere to the **Scout Rule** and have *hopefully* left the code a little cleaner than what was originally supplied. I tried to improve the codebase with long-term sustainability in mind, and made sure that all links are functioning correctly. I've also reworked the <a href="https://github.com/MissNG-Git/BCS_Code-Refactor/blob/main/Develop/assets/css/style.css">CSS</a> to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Objectives
```
+ SUPPLY a webpage that meets accessibility standards
+ WHEN viewing source code : THEN FIND semantic HTML elements
+ WHEN viewing structure of the HTML elements : THEN FIND elements following a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning
+ WHEN viewing image elements : THEN FIND accessible alt attributes
+ WHEN viewing heading attributes : THEN FIND they fall in sequential order
+ WHEN I view the title element : THEN FIND a concise, descriptive title
```

## Target Design

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
